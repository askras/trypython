# Sorting algorithms

Sorting is a process for arranging items in a list.
In the case when an item in the list has several fields, the field serving
the order criterion is called the sort key.
In practice, a number often acts as a key, and the other fields store some
data that does not affect the operation of the algorithm in any way.
The way the data is arranged in a certain order is determined
by the sorting algorithm.
The most typical orders are lexical or numeric.

Sorting is used to present data in the most
human-readable form.

Also, many data search algorithms can be significantly optimized when
working with sorted data.

The purpose of this section is to collect in one place the existing sorting
algorithms with their brief description.
